- Hi, I'm Tyler.
- I'm currently studying computer engineering.
- I chose my major because I was interested in both computer science and electrical engineering.
- A fun fact about me is: I like animals.
- What do I want to learn from EE 205? I want to be comfortable enough to use my programming skills in any applicable sitatuion.
- A book or movie I'd recommend is: The Wild Robot.
